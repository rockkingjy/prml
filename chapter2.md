## Axiom I：Principle of superposition
#### A.  Definition of quantum states and the general principle of superposition
#### B.  Mathematical formulation of the principle
#### C.  Dirac's notation for vectors:  the ket
ket: $|A>$  
#### D.  Dirac's introduction of inner product function and bra vectors
bra: $<A|$
#### E.  The dual relationship between ket and bra

## Axiom II：Principle of observables
#### A.  Linear operators （q-numbers）
#### B.  Operator operating on the bra vectors
#### C.  Conjugate relations
#### D.  Eigenvalues，eigenvectors and eigenspace

1. Hermitian operators' eigenvalues are real numbers.  
2. Hermitian operators' different eigenvalues' eigenvectors are orthogonal with each other.  

#### F.  Axioms of observables in quantum mechanics and explanation of the Stern-Gerlach experiment
Now mathematics comes to the real physical world by the axiom:  
Hermitian Operators are physical observables.
